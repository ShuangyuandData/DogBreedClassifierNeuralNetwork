### Summary: 
1. Identify an estimate of the canine’s breed given an image of a dog or identify the resembling dog breed if supplied an image of a human.
2. Detect human faces with the OpenCV’s implementation of Haar feature-based cascade classifiers and detect dogs using ResNet-50.
3. Apply Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) using transfer learning to classify dog breeds.
4. The final test accuracy reaches over 80%.
