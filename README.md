### Summary: 
The project identifies an estimate of the canine’s breed given an image of a dog or identify the resembling dog breed if supplied an image of a human.

### Libraries:
scilearn, keras, glob, numpy, matlibplot, PIL

### Details:
1. Detect human faces with the OpenCV’s implementation of Haar feature-based cascade classifiers and detect dogs using ResNet-50.
2. Apply Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) using transfer learning to classify dog breeds.
3. The final test accuracy reaches over 80%.
