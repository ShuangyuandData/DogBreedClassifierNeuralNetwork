### Summary: 
This project uses Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to build a pipeline to process real-world, user-supplied images. 
Given an image of a dog, the project will identify an estimate of the canineâ€™s breed. 
If supplied an image of a human, the code will identify the resembling dog breed.
